##Week 09 Homework

Problem #1

For this prompt, I made two sketches. The first sketch, I just copied the code that was uploaded from class, in order to better understand the code itself, as well as how the classes are interacting with each other. In the second sketch, I wanted to riff off the class code by adding my own arguments. I also wanted to add a GUI so that I can figure out I can change the movement of the particles and the how to manipulate the vector field.

I feel like by taking this approach, I succeeded in my attempt to better understand how to build a vector field.

Update: I just realized that I labeled this one as #1 but this is actually for #2

Real Problem #1

For this example, I took the class example, and started to mess around with some of the arguments in the example. In the end I got something that I thought was interesting and something that I might want to take further in future projects.

Problem #3

In this sketch, I just took what I did from the second sketch and combined it with the 3D Vector Field example from class. By combining the two and implementing a GUI to the sketch, it helped me understand how to manipulate the field in a 3D space.
