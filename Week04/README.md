##Week 04 Homework

###Problem A

The intention was to two circles, one continuously orbitting, the other standing still. I wanted to add a GUI controller to the orbitting circle to control the speed, colors, and size of the orbitting circle. I couldn't figure out how to control the speed, and the orbitting circle duplicated itself when I tried to to add the GUI to it.

Then I decided to add some key controls to the static circle. The only color that responds to the keys is the blue, I am not sure why the red and green don't work since the code is written the same.

###Problem B

My intention for this exercise was to have the particles be attracted to the mouse, and when the mouse is pressed, the particles will be replled from the mouse.

###Problem C
In this exercise, I took codes from two examples in openFrameworks, asciiVideo and videoPlayerExample. I wanted to experiment and familiarize myself with using code creatively with a video I've uploaded.
