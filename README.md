##Vivian's Weekly Homeworks


### Week 2

Problem A- fairly simple. I just sampled the code from class to give the square some bounding constraints. However, it is annoying to me that half of the square falls off the screen before it is recognized as going off screen. I know that that is because the vector point is in the center of the square, but I don't know know how to set it so that it reads off screen when it hits the edge of the square.

The trailing effect is a little different than how you give that command in processing, but I kind of knew that you had to change the opacity of the screen so that it leaves a trail when the square moves. However, what I got was the the result I was expecting.

Problem B - What.....? update: I think I got it?

Problem C - Also what...?

Problem D - I wanted to make each ball randomly different colors, not changing colors randomly. Tried a couple of codes in there, but it's either doing all the same color or just continuously changing color. Also, I still don't know how to write arrays.


###Week 1
Did okay. Everything is starting to make sense
