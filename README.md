##Midterm Final Proposal


After a discussion with Regina about the direction I would like to take in this class, she suggested I try to re-imagine some past shorts films I have produced in the past as creative codes. I am interested in making an abstract-experimental piece with shapes and textures, and would focus utilizing flocking simulations.

I am inspired by the imagery in this example by Guillermo Bernal, and would look to this as a point of departure for my midterm.
