##Week 06 Homework

Problem A: In this example, I took the seek and avoid example from the class repo and tried to add some characters into it. It worked well when I had one zombie and one man(food), but when I added an array of men the zombie got confused and could not decided what direction to go in, so it would just stand still. I tried to add a GUI into the example to control the speed and force of the zombie, but once he stops, the GUI has no effect on him. I also added a size controller for a humorous effect.

Problem B: I tried to implement the path following algorithm into the zombie example I worked on. However, I could not get the path displayed correctly, and once I added the path to the code, my zombie just went black.

Problem C: For this flocking example, I tried to add the "field of vision" to the boids, but I could not figure out how to implement the tracking to my boids. I was able to put the boids into a 3D space, though, but I am not sure if they are moving in the entire space. I did experiment with the example from class and play around with numbers and equations when working on the problem, as well.
